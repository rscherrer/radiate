  abstract = {Speciation is often thought of as a slow process due to the waiting times for mutations that cause incompatibilities, and permit ecological differentiation or assortative mating. Cases of rapid speciation and particularly cases of rapid adaptive radiation into multiple sympatric species have remained somewhat mysterious. We review recent findings from speciation genomics that reveal an emerging commonality among such cases: reassembly of old genetic variation into new combinations facilitating rapid speciation and adaptive radiation. The polymorphisms in old variants frequently originated from hybridization at some point in the past. We discuss why old variants are particularly good fuel for rapid speciation, and hypothesize that variation in access to such old variants might contribute to the large variation in speciation rates observed in nature.},

  abstract = {Rapid adaptive radiation poses two distinct questions apart from speciation and adaptation: What happens after one speciation event and how do some lineages continue speciating through a rapid burst? We review major features of rapid radiations and their mismatch with theoretical models and speciation mechanisms. The paradox is that the hallmark rapid burst pattern of adaptive radiation is contradicted by most speciation models, which predict continuously decelerating diversification and niche subdivision. Furthermore, it is unclear if and how speciation-promoting mechanisms such as magic traits, phenotype matching, and physical linkage of coadapted alleles promote rapid bursts of speciation. We review additional mechanisms beyond ecological opportunity to explain rapid radiations: ( a) ancient adaptive alleles and the transporter hypothesis, ( b) sexual signal complexity, ( c) fitness landscape connectivity, ( d) diversity begets diversity, and ( e) plasticity first. We propose new questions and predictions connecting microevolutionary processes to macroevolutionary patterns through the study of rapid radiations.},
